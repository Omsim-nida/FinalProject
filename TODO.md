# TODO: Implement Folder-Based Database with Encapsulation and Notepad Integration

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Create FolderDatabase.java class with encapsulated folder operations (private fields for root path, methods for create/save/load/list).
- [x] Modify AdminDashboard.java to add a folder browser (JTree or JList) and mouse listener to open files in Notepad.
- [ ] Test folder creation and file operations in FolderDatabase.
- [ ] Run the application and verify Notepad opens on clicking data.
- [ ] Ensure encapsulation (no direct access to internal folder paths).
